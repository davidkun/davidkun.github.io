I don't know anything about Jekyll, and very little about GitHub Pages, but I'd like to start a mini-blog...so I'm giving this a go.

By the way, I'm not blogging because I think everyone should hear (read) what I have to say; rather, I'm blogging as an outlet--brain-dump--and a way to organize my thoughts.

I hope this works out.
