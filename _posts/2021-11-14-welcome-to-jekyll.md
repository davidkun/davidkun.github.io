I don't know anything about Jekyll, and very little about GitHub Pages, but I'd like to start a mini-blog...so I'm giving this a go.

By the way, I'm not blogging because I think everyone should read what I have to say (I don't). I'm blogging as an outlet (a brain-dump) and as a way to organize my thoughts.

I hope this works out.
