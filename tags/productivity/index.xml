      <description>Newport, Cal. Deep work: Rules for focused success in a distracted world. Hachette UK, 2016. The notes in Part I focus largely on context and provide definitions (what is Deep Work and why is it meaningful). Part II describes the four rules of Deep Work. If you&amp;rsquo;re in a rush to start working Deeply, jump straight to Rule 1: Work Deeply for guidance.
Part I Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limits.</description>
