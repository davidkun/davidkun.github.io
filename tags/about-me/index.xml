      <description>We all stand on the shoulders of others. Our ability to communicate and persist our ideas and discoveries has undoubtedly had a substantial impact on our technological and social evolution.&#xA;I keep track of the books, blogs, and videos that left a mark on me and impacted my growth and development. I do this partly to keep records (e.g., so I can go back and refresh my memory), partly to have a curated list for new developers who are interested in career growth, and partly for the potential of identifying patterns (meta-learning).</description>

      <description>Up until recently, I worked at The MITRE Corporation, an organization that manages several federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). The team I was part of maintains and evolves a big data platform (primarily aviation data, weather, terrain, etc.), enabling analysts to answer complex questions about the national airspace.&#xA;The platform work mainly involved writing Java and working with Hadoop (plus Avro, Parquet, Spark, Crunch, Kafka, Flink, etc.). More recently, we began focusing on cloud migration, intelligent/automated operations, and data observability.</description>
