      <description>Newport, Cal. Deep work: Rules for focused success in a distracted world. Hachette UK, 2016. The notes in Part I focus largely on context and provide definitions (what is Deep Work and why is it meaningful). Part II describes the four rules of Deep Work. If you&amp;rsquo;re in a rush to start working Deeply, jump straight to Rule 1: Work Deeply for guidance.
Part I Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limits.</description>

      <description>I got a LinkedIn marketing email that actually caught my eye: &amp;ldquo;take a LinkedIn skills assessment to show recruiters you are in the top 30% for that skill set.&amp;rdquo; I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t care about getting a &amp;ldquo;badge&amp;rdquo;, but I was genuinely curious to see what kind of questions would be asked.
On their help page, they explain that assessments are created by &amp;ldquo;subject matter experts&amp;rdquo; and questions are peer-reviewed. I was hoping that I could find interesting material to incorporate into our evolving technical interview process.</description>

      <description>We all stand on the shoulders of others. Our ability to communicate and persist our ideas and discoveries has undoubtedly had a substantial impact on our technological and social evolution.
I keep track of the books, blogs, and videos that left a mark on me and impacted my growth and development. I do this partly to keep records (e.g., so I can go back and refresh my memory), partly to have a curated list for new developers who are interested in career growth, and partly for the potential of identifying patterns (meta-learning).</description>
