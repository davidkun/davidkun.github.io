I work at a not-for-profit company (The [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) Corporation) that serves the public interest and solves problems for a safer world. More specifically, I'm on a team that manages, maintains, and evolves a big data platform (primarily aviation/aerospace data).

I'm most interested in sustainable development, software quality, software testing, and reproducible research.
