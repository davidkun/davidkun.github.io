I work at a not-for-profit company (The [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) Corporation) that serves the public interest and solves problems for a safer world. More specifically, I'm on a team that manages, maintains, and evolves a big data platform (primarily aviation/aerospace data).

Most of the platform work involves programming in Java and working with Hadoop (and Spark, Kafka, Crunch, Flink, Avro, Parquet, etc.). I do most of my data analysis with Python, Clojure, and sometimes R.

I'm primarily interested in sustainable development practices, software quality, software testing, and reproducible research. The overarching theme of my interests is **continuous improvement**.
