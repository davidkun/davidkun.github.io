## Leadership: The Single Most Important Factor

Most leadership books focus on individual practices / personal character traits. But _without a team there can be no leadership_.

**Team**: _a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission_.

Leadership requires a diverse team of people in various groups to execute highly complex missions in order to achieve strategic goals

The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails. The two characterizations a of leader that matter: effective and ineffective. **Effective leaders lead successful teams that accomplish their missions and win** (ineffective leaders do not).

* There are no infallible leaders, therefore, the following are essential to success:
    * The humility to admit and own mistakes
    * The ability to develop a plan to overcome the mistakes
* The best leaders focus on the mission and how best to accomplish it

The underlying principle (the mind-set) that provides the foundation for the rest of the book is _"extreme ownership"_.

**Extreme Ownership**: _leaders must own everything in their world; there is no one else to blame_.

The principles empower teams to dominate their battlefields by enabling leaders to fulfill their purpose: lead and win.

## Winning the War Within (Principles)

The following principles empower teams to dominate their battlefields by enabling leaders to fulfill their purpose: _lead and win_.

### Extreme Ownership

* The leader is truly and ultimately responsible for everything; there is no one else to blame
* Extreme Ownership is the fundamental core of what constitutes an effective leader
* The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win
* The leader must set ego aside, accept responsibility for failures, attack weaknesses, and consistently work to build a more effective team
* The leader does not take credit for his team’s successes, but bestows that honor upon his team members
* When people see Extreme Ownership in their leaders, they emulate it down the chain of command
    * As a group, they try to figure out how to fix their problems, instead of what to blame

### No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders

* When it comes to standards of performance, as a leader, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate
* Regardless of what’s said or written, if sub-standard performance is accepted (no one held accountable), the poor performance becomes the new standard
* Leaders must enforce standards
* Consequences for failing don’t need to be immediately severe, but the tasks should be repeated until they meet expectations
* Leadership is all about providing a forcing function to get different members working together to accomplish the mission
* Leaders should never be satisfied; they must always strive to improve, and push standards higher

### Believe

* Leaders must be true believers in the mission to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish the mission
* Leaders must always understand that they are part of something greater than themselves
* They must impart this understanding to their team
* Belief in the mission is critical for any team to win and achieve big results
* Leaders must be able to detach from the tactical mission and understand how it fits into strategic goals
* When leaders are told to do something they don’t understand, they must ask “why?”
* It is critical that leaders impart a general understanding of their strategic knowledge — the _why_ — to their team

### Check the Ego

* Ego clouds and disrupts everything (planning, ability to take good advice/criticism, seeing the world as it is)
* To implement Extreme Ownership, you must check your ego and have a high degree of humility
* Admit to mistakes, take ownership, and develop a plan to overcome challenges
* The leader and team should be confident _but not cocky_, and must never get complacent


## Laws of Combat (Strategies)

### Cover and Move

* The most fundamental tactic: cover & moves means **teamwork**
* All elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission
    * Mutually supportive for that singular purpose
* Groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other, and understand who depends on them
* Leaders must continually keep perspective on the strategic mission and **remind the team** they are part of a greater team/mission

### Simple

* Simplifying as much as possible (the inherent layers of complexities) is crucial to success
* Complicated plans/orders may not be understood
* When things go wrong, complexity compounds issues that can spiral out of control into chaos
* **Plans and orders must be simple, clear, and concise**
* Every team member must understand their role in the mission (and their responsibility during contingencies)
* If the team doesn’t understand the plan/order/tactic, _you’ve failed as a leader_

### Prioritize and Execute

* Leaders must remain calm and make the best possible decisions
* **Relax, look around, make a call**
    * Leaders must pull themselves off the firing line, step back, and maintain the strategic picture
* Leaders must determine the highest priority task and execute
* Stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems (e.g. anticipate challenges with contingency planning)
    * Stay ahead of the curve to prevent being overwhelmed
* A team that’s been briefed on contingency plans can rapidly execute when problems arise
* When priorities change, communication of that shift (up & down chain of command) is critical

The process:

1. Evaluate highest priority problem
2. Explain the highest priority effort to your team in simple, clear, concise terms
3. Determine a solution (seek input from leaders/team when possible)
4. Focus all effort towards this priority task and direct execution
5. Don’t get target fixation; maintain the ability to see other problems developing

### Decentralized Command

* Humans aren’t capable of managing more than 6-10 people
* Teams must be broken down into manageable elements (4-5 people)
* Tactical-level leaders must understand both the “what” and the “why” of what they’re doing
* Junior leaders must understand what is within their decision-making authority
* They must communicate up the chain to recommend decisions outside their authority and be proactive
* Information must be pushed both up and down the chain of command (“situational awareness”)


## Sustaining Victory (Operations)

### Plan

* Having a standardized planning process is essential for success
* Planning begins with mission analysis
    * Understand higher headquarters’ mission, **Commander’s Intent (CI)**, and end-state
    * Identify and state your own CI and end-state for the specific mission
* Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available
    * Lean on expertise and use all resources
* Decentralize the planning process
    * Empower key leaders within the team to analyze possible courses of action
    * This gives them buy-in, helps them understand the mission, and strengthens their belief in the mission
* Determine a specific course of action
    * Lean towards the simplest course of action, and focus all efforts there
* Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action
* Plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation
* Mitigate risks that can be controlled
* Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders
    * Stand back and be the “tactical genius” (ensure compliance with strategic objectives; don’t get lost in details)
* Continually check/question the plan against emerging information
* Brief plan to all participants
    * Emphasize CI
    * Ask question and engage in discussion with the team to ensure they understand
* Conduct post-operational debrief after execution
    * Analyze lessons learned and implement them in future planning

### Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command

Down the chain:

* Leaders have insight into the bigger picture/strategy, but not the tactical details
* Junior members have the opposite insights
* It’s critical that each have an understanding of the other’s role
* Leader must explain to the troops how their role contributes to the big picture success
* Routinely communicate with team so everyone understand their role in the mission
* Requires stepping out of the office, and personally engaging in face-to-face conversations

Up the chain:

* Leaders must support their own boss
* Tactfully engage with your boss to push situational awareness up the chain of command
* If you don’t understand decisions being made, ask these question up the chain of command

The major factors:

* Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world (both superiors & subordinates)
* If someone’s not doing what you want/need, examine how you can better enable them
* Don’t ask your leader what you should do; tell them what you’re going to do

### Decisiveness Amid Uncertainty

* There’s great pressure from uncertainty, chaos, and the unknown, but leaders can’t be paralyzed by fear (this results in inaction)
* It is critical for leaders to act decisively amid uncertainty, to make the best decisions based on the immediate information available
* There’s no 100% “right” solution, and waiting for it will lead to delay, indecision, and inability to execute
* Leaders must be able to make decisions promptly and be ready to adjust those decision quickly based on new information


# Discipline Equals Freedom — The Dichotomy of Leadership

A good leader must be all of the following:

* Confident but not cocky
* Courageous but not foolhardy
* Competitive but a gracious loser
* Attentive to details but not obsessed by them
* Strong but have endurance
* A leader and a follower
* Humble, not passive
* Aggressive, not overbearing
* Quiet, not silent
* Calm but not robotic
* Logical but not devoid of emotions
* Close with the troops, but not so close that one becomes more important than the good of the team
* Able to execute Extreme Ownership while exercising Decentralized Command
