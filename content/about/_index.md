I work at The [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) Corporation, a not-for-profit organization that manages several federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) (mission: "solving problems for a safer world"). More specifically, I'm on a team that manages, maintains, and evolves a big data platform (primarily aviation data, but also other modes of transportation, weather, etc.).

Most of the platform work involves programming in Java and working with Hadoop (plus Avro, Parquet, Spark, Crunch, Kafka, Flink, etc.). Recently, we've been focusing more on cloud migration, intelligent/automated operations, and data observability. When I do (usually quick) data science/analysis, I typically use Python and Clojure.

I'm primarily interested in sustainable development practices, software quality, software testing, and reproducible research. The overarching theme of my work/career is **continuous improvement**.
